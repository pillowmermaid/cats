# cats
A react-redux app that pulls in facts and pictures of cats making use of the [Cat Facts API](catfacts-api.appspot.com/)
and the [The Cat API](http://thecatapi.com/)

Use `npm install` to get what you need

`npm run start` starts your webpack server and running `grunt` will take care of your sass!

Mousing over an image will give you a fact, clicking on them will remove them from the app.
